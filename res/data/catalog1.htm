<!--// 	INSTRUCTIONS FOR EDITING THIS RYUZINERACK DATA TABLE //
	1. 	Do not put any HTML code in the table cells.  Plain text data ONLY.
	2. 	Do not insert <img> tags, just file names with the extension.
	3. 	Do not use full URL paths to images UNLESS you left the rackImg variable empty in your config file
	4. 	Cover Thumbnails need to be provided in two sizes:
			180x250 for standard definition screens
			360x500 for high density screens (like Apple's "Retina" displays)
			(images are fitted by width, if they are longer it will simply crop the bottom)
	5. 	Promotion Images also need to be provied in two sizes:
			640x300 for standard definition screens
			1280x600 for high density screens
	6. 	If you do not want to make a Promo image you can simply enter the word "auto" (without quotes)
		and a promotional box will be automatically created from the other data for that item.
	7. 	You can have as many Media Types and Categories as you like and call them whatever you like.
	8. 	You can use just about any date format you want, though Month and Year work best you can mix date formats.
	9. 	URLs should be simple text not <a> links.
	10.	You can extend this table with additional sortable or non-sortable data columns.  If you make the column 
		sortable the column header text is used in the Sort List within the RyuzineRack webapp.
